# kotlin-vendingmachine-precourse

Implement a vending machine that returns change using the fewest number of coins possible.

## Requirements

- The machine randomly generates coins using the initial amount provided.
    - Only 500 KRW, 100 KRW, 50 KRW, 10 KRW.
    - Coins are generated only for the amount initially entered â€” no additional coins are created beyond that.
- Machine returns the fewest number of coins possible. No bills
- User add products with name, price, quantity.
    - Product prices start at 100 and must be divisible by 10!.
- Users can purchase products with the amount inserted.
    - if the remaining balance is less than the price of the cheapest product, or all products sold out, the machine
      immediately returns change.
- The machine returns as much as it can, using available coins.
    - Any unreturned balance remains in the vending machine.
- Invalid input -> throw IllegalArg and re-prompt from the step.
